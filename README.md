# CS-210 Portfolio


### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
In project 3 for CS-210 I developed a basic grocery-store analytics system using C++. My code processes input data, enables the user to interact with stats drawn from the input data, and saves stats to a "backup" file.

### What did you do particularly well?
